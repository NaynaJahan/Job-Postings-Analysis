# Job-Postings-Analysis
Analyzing job postings pertaining to AI using different search algorithms and emphasize qualifications and skills the industry expects from AI professionals.

For this study, an informed search method was selected to retrieve pertinent AI-related job postings. In particular, the Greedy Best-First Search (GBFS) algorithm was used because it prioritizes nodes (in this example, job ads) that seem most promising according to a defined heuristic, making it effective at navigating enormous search spaces. The Beam Search algorithm was also considered to filter job postings containing AI-related keywords across relevant columns. In this study, the dataset size is manageable, and high precision is essential; hence, GBFS can provide more accurate relevance ratings as it considers every possibility.
